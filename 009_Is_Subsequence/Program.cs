             * Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
             * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters 
               without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
             
             * Follow up:
             * If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. 
               In this scenario, how would you change your code?

             * Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

             *   Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
             *   Output: true
